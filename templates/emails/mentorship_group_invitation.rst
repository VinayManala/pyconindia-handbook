Hey,

This email is in regards to PyCon India 2020 mentorship group. In 2020, we are going virtual which means we have less work to do around venue preparation and logistics. We (conference organizers) take this as an opportunity to direct our efforts in making this conference a great experience for attendees in other ways.

One way we can do that is to help bring out the best in our speakers. We see value in pre-event rehearsals of the talks and have put together a great team of volunteers to help speakers in tweaking their presentation. Since this is a peer review process and driven by volunteers, we are looking for more volunteers to join us and help in making this a success. We believe you have great experience in Python and/or Python community and we would love if you can be a part of this group.

While our roles and responsibilities will evolve over time, basic responsibility is to "volunteer for a few talks you see fit as per your skills (we will help you with this) and provide your feedback to the speaker about their way of presentation and slides (if you see something that can be improved).

If you think you can help us with this, please reply to the email confirming and we will add you to the group where we will discuss and plan/schedule sessions.

Info: This is a later process (post CFP and before conference) so we don't exacly have any urgent commitments.

Thank You
